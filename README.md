# red-head README

This Red Head. A VS-Code Extension for Solana Developers. Red Head is literally brand new, so feel free to drop ideas or suggestions as I go.

As it stands right now, I aim to have two major features integrated into Red Head.

1. A simple Wallet that leverages keypairs already in your project.
2. A Solana explorer that you can use to check account state + transactions while developing.

## How to run

1. npm install
2. npm run webpack
3. F5 ( F5 will launch your extension and open a new VS-Code Window where you can then test Red Head )

## Ideas
- Right now, I open the "wallet" by being selected on the file with the keypair and running the command, it would be interesting to have a larger "wallet managment view" that you can point at different sources of wallets, maybe just one, maybe on your system idk, but then you can manage the contents of these wallets overall
- On the wallet view, add a refresh button to pull current state but all some kind of "monitor" or "live view" so that as updates happen we can update the view automatically
