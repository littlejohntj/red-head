# red-head README

This Red Head. A VS-Code Extension for Solana Developers. Red Head is literally brand new, so feel free to drop ideas or suggestions as I go.

As it stands right now, I aim to have two major features integrated into Red Head.

1. A simple Wallet that leverages keypairs already in your project.
2. A Solana explorer that you can use to check account state + transactions while developing.

## How to run

1. npm install
2. npm run webpack
3. F5 ( F5 will launch your extension and open a new VS-Code Window where you can then test Red Head )
